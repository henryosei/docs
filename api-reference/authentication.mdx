## Overview

The Fraudiant API uses **Bearer token authentication** to secure all API endpoints. You must include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

<Warning>
  Your API key is sensitive and should be kept secure. Never expose it in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

## Getting Your API Key

To obtain your API credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register an Account">
    Sign up at [app.fraudiant.com](https://app.fraudiant.com) to create your free account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Dashboard">
    Log in to your dashboard after registration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to the **API Keys** section from the main navigation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate or Retrieve Keys">
    Create a new API key or copy an existing one. You can create separate keys for different environments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Methods

### Recommended: Authorization Header

The **recommended and most secure method** is to include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer token format:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]',
    headers=headers
)

data = response.json()
```

```php PHP
<?php
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
]);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

$data = json_decode($response, true);
?>
```

```ruby Ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'json'

uri = URI('https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]')
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Authorization'] = 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
  http.request(request)
end

data = JSON.parse(response.body)
```

```go Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    client := &http.Client{}
    req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]", nil)
    req.Header.Add("Authorization", "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY")

    resp, _ := client.Do(req)
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    body, _ := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Not Recommended: Query Parameter

<Warning>
  While you can pass your API key as a query parameter, **this method is not recommended** for security reasons as API keys may be exposed in logs, browser history, or URL histories.
</Warning>

```bash
# Not recommended - API key exposed in URL
curl "https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Why this is insecure:**
- API keys appear in server logs
- Keys are visible in browser history
- URLs may be cached or stored by proxies
- Risk of accidental exposure when sharing URLs

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store API keys as environment variables">
    Never hardcode API keys directly in your source code. Use environment variables or secret management systems:

    ```javascript
    // ✅ Good
    const apiKey = process.env.FRAUDIANT_API_KEY;

    // ❌ Bad
    const apiKey = 'fdt_live_abc123...';
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use separate keys for different environments">
    Create distinct API keys for development, staging, and production environments. This makes it easier to rotate keys and debug issues without affecting production.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Periodically regenerate your API keys, especially after team member departures or if you suspect a key has been compromised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restrict key permissions">
    If available, use API keys with the minimum necessary permissions for your use case.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never commit keys to version control">
    Add your environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`, etc.) to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits:

    ```bash
    # .gitignore
    .env
    .env.local
    .env.production
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor API key usage">
    Regularly review API usage in your dashboard to detect any unusual activity that might indicate a compromised key.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when the API key is missing, invalid, or expired:

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "error": "Unauthorized. Please provide a valid API key."
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Invalid or expired API key
- Incorrect Bearer token format

### 403 Forbidden

Returned when the API key doesn't have permission for the requested resource:

```json
{
  "status": 403,
  "error": "This feature requires a Pro account."
}
```

## Testing Your Authentication

Use this simple test to verify your authentication is working:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

A successful response will return a `200` status code with email validation data.

<Info>
  If you receive a `401 Unauthorized` error, double-check that your API key is correct and properly formatted in the Authorization header.
