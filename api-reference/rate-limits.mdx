description: "Understand API rate limits, quotas, and best practices for optimizing your API usage."

## Overview

Fraudiant enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and maintain service quality for all customers. Rate limits vary based on your subscription plan and authentication status.

<Info>
  Rate limits apply **per API key** and are counted across all environments (development, staging, production).
</Info>

## Rate Limit Tiers

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Free Plan" icon="gift">
    **1 request/second**

    Sufficient for development and small applications
  </Card>

  <Card title="Pro Plan" icon="rocket">
    **5-50 requests/second**

    Varies by plan tier. Suitable for production applications
  </Card>

  <Card title="Unauthenticated" icon="lock-open">
    **5 requests/hour**

    Very limited. Authentication required for normal use
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  Unauthenticated requests are severely limited and intended only for testing. Always authenticate your requests for production use.
</Warning>

---

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes headers that help you track your rate limit usage:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 50
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 42
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="integer">
  Maximum requests allowed per time window
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="integer">
  Number of requests remaining in the current window
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="timestamp">
  Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets
</ResponseField>

---

## Rate Limit Exceeded Response

When you exceed your rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code:

```json
{
  "status": 429,
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before making more requests.",
  "retry_after": 30
}
```

<ResponseField name="retry_after" type="integer">
  Number of seconds to wait before making another request
</ResponseField>

### IP Blocking

<Warning>
  Repeated rate limit violations (sustained abuse) will trigger **temporary IP blocking** lasting approximately **one hour**.
</Warning>

If your IP is blocked, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "status": 403,
  "error": "IP temporarily blocked due to rate limit violations",
  "blocked_until": "2024-01-15T11:30:00Z"
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monitor rate limit headers">
    Always check the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header and implement logic to slow down requests when approaching the limit.

    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.fraudiant.com/email/[email protected]', {
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
    });

    const remaining = response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Remaining');

    if (remaining < 10) {
      console.warn('Approaching rate limit. Implement backoff strategy.');
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implement exponential backoff">
    When receiving 429 responses, implement exponential backoff to avoid continued rate limit violations:

    ```javascript
    async function fetchWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
      for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
        const response = await fetch(url, options);

        if (response.status === 429) {
          const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After') || Math.pow(2, i);
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));
          continue;
        }

        return response;
      }

      throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache validation results">
    Cache email and domain validation results to reduce redundant API calls:

    ```javascript
    const cache = new Map();

    async function validateEmail(email) {
      if (cache.has(email)) {
        return cache.get(email);
      }

      const response = await fetch(`https://api.fraudiant.com/email/${email}`, {
        headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
      });

      const data = await response.json();

      // Cache for 24 hours
      cache.set(email, data);
      setTimeout(() => cache.delete(email), 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

      return data;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use batch operations when available">
    For bulk validation, consider accumulating emails and processing them in batches rather than making individual requests for each email.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Choose the right plan tier">
    Monitor your usage patterns and upgrade your plan if you frequently hit rate limits. Pro plans offer significantly higher limits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Distribute load across time">
    Avoid sending all requests at once. Distribute validation requests throughout your workflow to stay within rate limits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use separate API keys per environment">
    Create separate API keys for development, staging, and production. This prevents development testing from consuming production quotas.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monthly Quotas

In addition to per-second rate limits, your plan includes a **monthly request quota**:

| Plan | Monthly Quota |
|------|---------------|
| Free | 10,000 requests/month |
| Pro Starter | 100,000 requests/month |
| Pro Business | 500,000 requests/month |
| Pro Enterprise | Custom limits |

<Info>
  Monthly quotas reset on the first day of each month. Unused requests do not roll over.
</Info>

### Quota Exceeded Response

When you exceed your monthly quota:

```json
{
  "status": 429,
  "error": "Monthly quota exceeded",
  "message": "You have reached your monthly request limit. Please upgrade your plan or wait for quota reset.",
  "quota_resets_at": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Testing Rate Limits

During development, you can test your rate limit handling by:

1. **Making rapid sequential requests** to trigger 429 responses
2. **Monitoring response headers** to verify your parsing logic
3. **Testing backoff strategies** to ensure graceful degradation

```javascript
// Example: Test rate limit handling
async function testRateLimits() {
  const requests = Array(100).fill(null).map((_, i) =>
    fetch(`https://api.fraudiant.com/email/test${i}@example.com`, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
    })
  );

  const responses = await Promise.allSettled(requests);

  const rateLimited = responses.filter(r =>
    r.status === 'fulfilled' && r.value.status === 429
  );

  console.log(`${rateLimited.length} requests were rate limited`);
}
```

<Warning>
  Avoid sustained rate limit testing in production to prevent IP blocking.
</Warning>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do rate limits apply across all environments?">
    Yes. Rate limits are tied to your API key, and all requests using that key count toward your limit regardless of environment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I exceed my rate limit?">
    You'll receive a 429 status code and must wait before making more requests. Repeated violations may result in temporary IP blocking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I request a rate limit increase?">
    Yes. Upgrade to a Pro plan for higher limits, or contact sales for custom enterprise quotas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do failed requests count toward my quota?">
    Yes. All requests, including those that return errors, count toward your rate limits and monthly quota.
  </Accordion>
