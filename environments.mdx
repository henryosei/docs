## Overview

Fraudiant provides three separate environments to help you organize API usage across different stages of development:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Development" icon="code">
    Local development and testing
  </Card>

  <Card title="Staging" icon="flask">
    Pre-production testing environment
  </Card>

  <Card title="Production" icon="rocket">
    Live, customer-facing application
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Environment-Specific Features

The following features are **isolated per environment**:

### Domain Blocklists
Custom blocklists are maintained separately for each environment. Domains blocked in production won't affect your development or staging environments.

### Webhook Configurations
Configure different webhook endpoints for each environment. Point production webhooks to live systems while development webhooks target localhost or testing tools.

### Usage Analytics
View usage logs, analytics, and metrics separately for each environment to track consumption patterns.

### API Key Organization
Create and manage environment-specific API keys to keep your workflows organized and secure.

## Shared Across All Environments

<Warning>
  All environments use the **same production API infrastructure**, and all requests count toward your **shared monthly quota**.
</Warning>

This means:
- **Rate limits** apply across all environments combined
- **Billing quotas** are shared (e.g., 10,000 requests/month applies to all environments)
- **API responses** use the same validation logic and data
- **Performance** is consistent across all environments

## How to Use Environments

### Creating Environment-Specific API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access API Keys">
    Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your [dashboard](https://app.fraudiant.com).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Click **Create New Key** and provide a descriptive name (e.g., "Production API Key" or "Dev Environment").
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Environment">
    Choose the target environment: Development, Staging, or Production.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Copy">
    Save the key and copy it to your application's configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The environment is determined automatically by which API key you use — no manual specification is needed in your requests.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use separate keys for each environment">
    Never use your production API key in development or staging. This prevents accidental modifications to production data and makes debugging easier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test blocklists in development first">
    Before adding domains to your production blocklist, test them in development or staging to ensure they don't block legitimate users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configure environment-specific webhooks">
    Use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com) for local webhook testing in development.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor quota usage across environments">
    Remember that all environments share the same quota. Heavy testing in development can impact production availability.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Configuration

Here's how you might organize API keys across environments:

```javascript
// config.js
const config = {
  development: {
    apiKey: process.env.FRAUDIANT_DEV_API_KEY,
    baseUrl: 'https://api.fraudiant.com'
  },
  staging: {
    apiKey: process.env.FRAUDIANT_STAGING_API_KEY,
    baseUrl: 'https://api.fraudiant.com'
  },
  production: {
    apiKey: process.env.FRAUDIANT_PROD_API_KEY,
    baseUrl: 'https://api.fraudiant.com'
  }
};

export default config[process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'];
```

<Note>
  Store API keys as environment variables and never commit them to version control.
</Note>
